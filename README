clirip
command line tool to rip and encode movies on the fly

The basic idea behind clirip is to have one command to get the ripped and encoded movie file on the harddisk. 
No worry about temporary files, no additional diskspace needed...

It is a quite simple shell script that uses mencoder and transcode.
transcode command lines are little more than just inspired by dvd::rip - thank god for Free software

You can try if your satisfied with the default settings - you just need to specify the output with -o /path/to/movie.avi
